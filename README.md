# CPSC411-united_stocks

This project was created by Irvin Rafael, Anant Jain, Marius Iacob and Sergio Murguia for our CPSC 411 Class Mobile Application Development on iOS. 

We used the Swift programming language to create a stock app that would display information about stocks including if they were up/down in price and to show the history of that stock over the last few years. This was developed using Xcode on a Macbook and meant to be used for iOS devices.

I (Irvin) created the login and user account information for the app. I allowed users to create an account and sign in with their user information.
